# Web-Project
Purpose:
- Dabble in the basics to HTML, CSS, and maybe incorporate JS later on (not sure yet)
- Learn about the responsiveness of web pages across computer, tablet, and mobile platforms
- No real purpose for this site yet (probably never)

- Did not use FOUNDATION 6 as a template responsive css file for the site
- CSS markup is labeled to show where everything is located for easier appearance modification of the site


NOTE: SITE WON'T BE PUBLISHED ONLINE AND IS JUST FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY
